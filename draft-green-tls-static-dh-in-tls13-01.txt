          Data Center use of Static Diffie-Hellman in TLS 1.3
                 draft-green-tls-static-dh-in-tls13-01

Abstract

   Unlike earlier versions of TLS, current drafts of TLS 1.3 have
   instead adopted ephemeral-mode Diffie-Hellman and elliptic-curve
   Diffie-Hellman as the primary cryptographic key exchange mechanism
   used in TLS.  This document describes an optional configuration for
   TLS servers that allows for the use of a static Diffie-Hellman
   private key for all TLS connections made to the server.  Passive
   monitoring of TLS connections can be enabled by installing a
   corresponding copy of this key in each monitoring device.

1.  Introduction

   Unlike earlier versions of TLS, current drafts of TLS 1.3
   [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] do not provide support for the RSA handshake --
   and have instead adopted ephemeral-mode Diffie-Hellman (DHE) and
   elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) as the primary cryptographic
   key exchange mechanism used in TLS.

   While DHE and ECDHE are in nearly all ways an improvement over the
   TLS RSA handshake, the use of these mechanisms a limitation in

   certain enterprise settings.  Specifically, the use of ephemeral
   ciphersuites that provide Forward Secrecy is not compatible with
   enterprise network monitoring tools such as the use of Intrusion
   Detection Systems (IDS) and application monitoring systems to meet
   regulatory auditing requirements to passively monitor intranet TLS
   connections made between endpoints under the enterprise's control.
   This traffic includes TLS connections made from enterprise network
   security devices (firewalls) and load balancers at the edge of the
   enterprise network to internal enterprise TLS servers.  It does not
   include TLS connections traveling over the external Internet.

   Such monitoring is ubiquitous, indispensable and required by law in
   some industries.  This monitoring is required for effective, safe and
   legal operation of enterprise networks.  Loss of this capability may
   slow adoption of TLS 1.3.

   This document describes an optional configuration for TLS servers
   that allows for the use of a static Diffie-Hellman private key for
   all TLS connections made to the server.  Passive monitoring of TLS
   connections can be enabled by installing a corresponding copy of this
   key in each monitoring device.

   An advantage of this proposal is that it can be implemented using
   software modifications to the TLS server only, without the need to
   make changes to TLS client implementations.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  ASN.1

   The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652] and asymmetric key
   packages [RFC5958] are generated using ASN.1 [X680], which uses the
   Basic Encoding Rules (BER) and the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER)
   [X690].

2.  Enterprise Out-of-band TLS Decryption Architecture

   This document describes the use of a static Diffie-Hellman private
   key by servers for use in TLS 1.3 sessions internal to an enterprise
   network.  In Figure 1, the Web Servers use static (EC)DH for
   connections from the Load Balancer, and the Back-End Services use
   static (EC)DH for connections from the Web Servers.  The Load
   Balancer uses ephemeral (EC)DH for connections from external Browsers
   over the Internet, to provide Forward Secrecy on those connections

   that are exposed to third-party monitoring.  Internally, the static
   (EC)DH keys are provided to any TLS Decrypter devices, such as
   intrusion detection systems, application monitoring systems or
   network packet capture devices.

3.  Enterprise Requirements for Passive (out-of-band) TLS Decryption

   Enterprise networks based on this architecture have operational
   requirements for traffic monitoring and ex post facto analysis for
   purposes of:

   o  Application troubleshooting and performance analysis

   o  Fraud monitoring

   o  Security, including intrusion detection, malware detection,
      confidential data exfiltration and layer 7 DDoS protection

   o  Audit compliance

   o  Customer Experience Monitoring

Internet-Draft  Data Center use of Static Diffie-Hellman       July 2017


   Specific requirements to meet the listed operational requirements
   include:

   o  TLS decryption for network security monitoring tools must be done
      in real time with no gaps in decryption.

   o  The solution must be able to decrypt passively captured pcap
      traces.

   o  The solution must scale to handle thousands of TLS sessions/sec.

   o  Key material must be preserved a minimum of 30 days for back-in-
      time analysis.  Using the average time to breach detection as the
      guide for packet and key retention, the number of days increases.

   o  Key material must be encrypted during network transit

   o  The solution must not negatively impact the enterprise
      infrastructure (servers, network, etc.)

   o  The solution must be able to decrypt when a TLS session is reused.
      This may involve the use of a TLS decryption appliance.

   o  The solution must be able to decrypt in a physical data center, in
      a virtual environment, and in a cloud.

4.  Summary of the Existing Diffie-Hellman Handshake

   In TLS 1.3, servers exchange keys using two primary modes, DHE and
   ECDHE.  In a simplified view of the full handshake, the following
   steps occur:

   1.  The client generates an ephemeral public and private key, and
       transmits the public key within a "key_share" message, along with
       a random nonce (ClientHello.random).
   2.  The server generates an ephemeral public and private key, and
       transmits the public key within a "key_share" message, along with
       a random nonce (ServerHello.random).
   3.  The two parties now calculate a shared ECDHE secret by combining
       the other party's ephemeral public key with their own ephemeral
       private key.
   4.  A series of traffic and handshake keys is derived by combining
       this shared secret with various inputs from the handshake,
       including the ClientHello.random and ServerHello.random.
   5.  Data encryption is performed using the shared secret.

5.  Using static ECDHE on the server

   The proposal embodied in this draft modifies the standard TLS
   handshake summarized above in the following ways:

      For each elliptic curve (and FF-DH parameter length) supported by
      the server, the server is provisioned with a static ECDHE private/
      public key pair.  This key pair may be either:

      *  generated at server installation, and rotated at periodic
         intervals appropriate for any long-term server key,

      *  generated at a central key management server and distributed
         (in a secure encrypted form) to the appropriate endpoint
         servers.

      All steps of the original handshake proceed as above, with the
      following modification to server behavior.  Step (2) proceeds as
      follows:

   2.  The server transmits the static public key within a "key_share"
       message, along with a random nonce (ServerHello.random).

6.  Key Representation

   The Asymmetric Key Package [RFC5958] MUST be used to transfer the
   centrally managed Diffie-Hellman key pair.  The key package contains
   at least one Diffie-Hellman key pair.  Each Diffie-Hellman key pair
   is associated with a set of attributes, including the key validity
   period for that Diffie-Hellman key pair.

   OneAsymmetricKey is defined in Section 2 of [RFC5958].  The fields
   are used as follows:

   o  version MUST be set to v2, which has an integer value of 1.

   o  privateKeyAlgorithm MUST be set to the algorithm identifier of the
      Diffie-Hellman key pair.  For convenience, some popular algorithm
      identifiers are listed in Figure 2.

   o  privateKey MUST be set to the Diffie-Hellman private key encoded
      as an OCTET STRING.

   o  attributes MUST be included even though the field is optional.
      The set of attributes MUST include the key validity period
      attribute defined in Section 15 of [RFC7906].  Other attributes
      MAY be included as well.

   o  publicKey MUST be included even though the field is optional.  It
      MUST be set to the Diffie-Hellman public key, encoded as a BIT
      STRING.  This is the same BIT STRING that would be included in an
      X.509 certificate [RFC5280] for this public key.

   The CMS protecting content types [RFC5652][RFC5083] can be used to
   provide authentication and confidentiality protection for the
   Asymmetric Key Package:

   o  SignedData can be used to apply a digital signature to the
      Asymmetric Key Package.

   o  EncryptedData can be used to encrypt the Asymmetric Key Package
      with previously distributed symmetric encryption key.

   o  EnvelopedData can be used to encrypt the Asymmetric Key Package,
      where the sender and the receiver establish a symmetric encryption
      key using Diffie-Hellman key agreement.

   o  AuthEnvelopedData can be used to protect the Asymmetric Key
      Package where the sender and the receiver establish a symmetric
      authenticated encryption key using Diffie-Hellman key agreement.

7.  TLS Static DH Key (TSK) Protocol

   The TLS Static DH Key (TSK) Protocol is used in cases where the
   Diffie-Hellman keys are centrally managed.  The two main roles in the
   TSK protocol are "key manager" and "key consumer".  Key consumers can

   be TLS servers or TLS decrypters.  The key manager generates,
   distributes, and tracks static ECDHE keys used by key consumers.  TSK
   messaging is based on HTTPS [RFC2818].  Keys are transferred as
   Asymmetric Key Packages [RFC5958], using the profile in Section 6 of
   this document.

7.1.  Key Push

   An HTTPS-based TSK push is composed of the appropriate HTTP headers,
   followed by the binary value of the BER (Basic Encoding Rules)
   encoding of the Asymmetric Key Package.

   The Content-Type header MUST be application/cms [RFC7193] if the
   Asymmetric Key Package is encrypted with CMS [RFC6032].  The Content-
   Type header MUST be application/pkcs8 if the Asymmetric Key Package
   is transferred in plain text (within the encrypted HTTPS stream).

7.2.  Key Request

   A key consumer may request a key by providing a fingerprint [RFC6234]
   of the public key.  The key manager is responsible for determining if
   the key consumer is authorized to receive a copy of the key being
   requested.

   Example with plain text Asymmetric Key Package:

      GET /tsk/key/PublicKeyFingerprint
      Accept: application/pkcs8

   Example with CMS encrypted and/or signed Asymmetric Key Package:

      GET /tsk/key/PublicKeyFingerprint
      Accept: application/cms

   The response to the TSK push is composed of the appropriate HTTP
   headers, followed by the binary value of the BER (Basic Encoding
   Rules) encoding of the Asymmetric Key Package.

   The Content-Type header MUST be application/cms [RFC7193] if the
   Asymmetric Key Package is encrypted with CMS [RFC6032].  The Content-
   Type header MUST be application/pkcs8 if the Asymmetric Key Package
   is transferred in plain text (within the encrypted HTTPS stream).

8.  Alternative Solutions for Enterprise Monitoring and Troubleshooting

   o  Export of ephemeral keys

   o  Export of decrypted traffic from TLS proxy devices at the edge of
      the enterprise network

   o  Placement of TLS proxies in the enterprise network

   o  Reliance on TCP/IP headers not encrypted by TLS

   o  Reliance on application/server logs

   o  Doing troubleshooting and malware analysis at the endpoint.

   o  Adding a TCP or UDP extension to provide the information needed to
      do packet analysis.

9.  Weaknesses of Alternative Solutions

   Export of ephemeral keys:  Scale - In a large enterprise there will
         be billions of ephemeral keys to export and manage.  There will
         also be difficulty in transporting these keys to real time
         tools that need decrypted packets.  The complexity of the
         solution is a problem that adds risk.

   Export of decrypted traffic from TLS proxy devices:  Decrypted
         traffic at only the edge of the network is not adequate for the
         enterprise requirements listed above (troubleshooting, network
         security monitoring, etc...)

   TLS proxies in the network:  Inline TLS proxies will not scale to the
         number of decryption points needed within an enterprise.  Each
         inline proxy adds cost, latency, and production risk.

   Reliance on TCP/IP headers:  IP and/or TCP headers are not adequate
         for the enterprise requirements listed above.  Troubleshooters
         must be able to find transactions in a pcap trace, identified
         by markers like userids, session ids, URLs, and time stamps.
         Threat Detection teams must be able to look for Indicators of
         Compromise in the payload of packets, etc.

   Reliance on Application/server logs:  Logging is not adequate for the
         enterprise requirements listed above.  Code developers cannot
         anticipate every possible problem and put a log message in just
         the right place.  There are billions of lines of code in a data
         center, and it's not scalable to try and improve logging.

   Troubleshooting and malware analysis at the endpoint:  Endpoints
         don't have the robustness to do their own workload and handle
         the burden of the various enterprise requirements listed above.
         These requirements would include always-on full packet capture
         at the endpoint with no packet drops.

   Adding TCP/UDP extensions:  An important part of troubleshooting,
         network security monitoring, etc. is analysis of the
         application-specific payload of the packet.  It is not possible
         to anticipate ahead of time, among thousands of unique
         applications, which fields in the application payload will be
         important.

10.  Security considerations

   We now consider the security implications of the change described
   above:

   1.  The shift from fully-ephemeral ECHDE to partially static ECDHE
       affects the security properties offered by the TLS 1.3 handshake
       by eliminating the Forward Secrecy property provided by the
       server.  If a server is compromised and the private key is
       stolen, then an attacker who observes any TLS handshake (even one
       that occurred prior to the compromise) will be able to recover
       traffic encryption keys and will be able to decrypt traffic.

   2.  As long as the server static secret key is not compromised, the
       resulting protocol will provide strong cryptographic security, as
       long as the Diffie-Hellman parameters (e.g., finite-field group
       or elliptic curve) are correctly generated and provide security
       at a sufficient cryptographic security level.

   3.  Replay attacks are prevented due to the fact that the server
       generates a unique 32-byte ServerHello.random field using a
       strong random number generator, and this value is included in the
       traffic key derivation procedure.

   4.  A flaw in the generation of finite-field Diffie-Hellman
       parameters or the use of an insecure implementation could leak
       some bits of the static secret key over time.  This risk is not
       present in ephemeral DH implementations.  Implementers should use
       care to avoid such pitfalls.

   Thus the modification described in Section 10 represents a deliberate
   weakening of some security properties.  Implementers who choose to
   include this capability should carefully consider the risks to their
   infrastructure of using a handshake without Forward Secrecy.  Static
   ECDHE key pairs should be rotated regularly.

11.  IANA Considerations

   This document contains no actions for IANA.
